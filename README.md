# Netflix-Clone
A Netflix clone using HTML and CSS is a front-end development exercise that aims to replicate the look and feel of Netflix's user interface. It can be used to showcase popular Netflix titles, implement hover animations, and create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
